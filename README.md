# UVa

Back in university I was into competitive programming. 

For practice we did some of the UVa challenges (http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php).

These as well are quite old. Likely not the best of code quality, but they got the job done. Some of them had really exotic test cases if I remember right.

I would appreciate getting back into these. It keeps the mind sharp.

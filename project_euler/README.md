# Project Euler

Once upon a time in a galaxy far far away...

I was into Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net) challenges. 

These are old, and likely a sad state of code. I know that some of the solutions were not of the quick type. At the time I wasn't as altruistic, and got online help for a few of them.

I would certainly get back into doing these, they were awesome fun.
